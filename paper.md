# Summary

``AbEC``A framework developed in Python to test different components present in the 
literature on Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) that are used 
in optimization of Static and Dynamic problems.
It allows the components to be turned on/off in order to test the 
effectiveness of each one of them independently in a given problem.
