# AbEC


## Description
The AbEC (<ins>**A**</ins>djusta<ins>**b**</ins>le <ins>**E**</ins>volutionary <ins>**C**</ins>omponents) is a framework developed in Python to test different 
components present in the literature on Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) that are 
used in optimization of Static and Dynamic problems. It allows the components to be turned 
on/off in order to test the effectiveness of each one of them independently in a given 
problem.
Another characteristic is the possibility of configuring the parameters of both the 
optimizers (GA, PSO, DE, ES) and the characteristics of the Benchmarks.

## Usage

To use the framework, the easiest way is just clone the git repository and start to use.
For this, you can use the following command in your terminal:
 
```python
git clone https://github.com/AbEC-EC/AbEC.git
```

Now, you basically just need to adjust the algorithm in the way that you want and boom!!
